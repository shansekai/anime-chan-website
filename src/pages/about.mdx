### About

[Animechanapi][animechanapi] is a node based rest api that servers thousands of anime quotes.You can query
quotes based on characters and animes.

[Checkout The documentation to get started](/documentation)

### Reason

The primary reason behind creating this api was that I personally count not find a single api that servers anime quotes.There are several
apis that serves masssive anime information but none of them have a single end point for getting quotes. So I ended up creating
[animechan][animechanapi] and made it completely free and open source. No login or any authentication needed
just single rest end points and get quotes, as simple as that.
